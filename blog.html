            <div>
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-1">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
                <p>DOM is an acronym that stands for Document Object Model. When a webpage or HTML page loads in the browser, browser creates aDOM for the page.Itâ€™s how a web browser represents a web page internally</p>
                <h1 class="font-semibold text-2xl ">Purpose of DOM</h1>
                <p>DOM is W3 standard to understand the structure of HTML pages so that we can create, read, delete and manage DOM elements using JavaScript DOM methods <br>
                HTML DOM helps us to to understand and control the element structure using JavaScript methods. If we understand the DOM structure of a HTML structure of a HTML page, we can easily controls its elements, attributes and all nodes.</p>

            <!-- second question -->
            <div>
                <h1 class="text-2xl mt-3 text-blue-800 font-bold mb-1">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
                <p>There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors. <br>
                    <ol class="list-decimal ml-20">
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>getElementById()</li>
                        <li>querySelector()</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                      </ol>
                    <p>All those methods are properties of the document object. So in order to use one, we should prefix those elements with the document object as,</p>

                    <ol class="list-disc ml-20">
                        <li>document.getElementByTagName()</li>
                        <li>document.getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>document.getElementById()</li>
                        <li>document.querySelector()</li>
                        <li>document.querySelectorAll()</li>
                    </ol>
                   </p>

                <!-- third question -->
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 text-blue-800 mb-1">What is event bubble?</h1>
                <p>In the event bubble model, an event starts at the most specific element and then flows upward toward the least specific element.Let's look at the below figure:</p>

            </div>
            <!-- fourth question -->
            <div class="mt-6">
                <h class="text-2xl text-blue-800 font-bold mb-1">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h>
                <p>A callback function is a function  passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
                    A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.</p>
                    <p class="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Need of Callback functions</p>
                    <p>We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.</p>
